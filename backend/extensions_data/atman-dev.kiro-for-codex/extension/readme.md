A VS Code extension that brings spec-driven development to Codex CLI. Manage your specs, steering documents, and custom prompts visually while leveraging Codex CLI's powerful AI capabilities.

---

💡 **Announcement**:  
In the original **kiro-for-codex**, interacting with Codex required sending prompts through the terminal, which unfortunately reduced usability. To address this, I’ve been developing [**kiro-for-codex-ide**](https://github.com/atman-33/kiro-for-codex-ide), which passes the necessary prompts (such as those for spec creation) directly into the context of [Codex - OpenAI’s coding agent](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=openai.chatgpt).

This approach makes working with Codex much smoother, so moving forward I plan to focus development on **kiro-for-codex-ide** as the main project.

## Features

### ⚙️ Configuration

- **Approval Modes**: The `kiroCodex.codex.defaultApprovalMode` setting now supports two modes:
  - `full-auto`: (Default) Executes non-destructive commands automatically and asks for approval on failure.
  - `yolo`: Executes all commands without approval. Use with caution.


### 📝 SPEC Management

- Create Specs: generate requirements, design, and task documents with Codex CLI
- Visual Explorer: browse and manage specs in the sidebar
- Spec Workflow: Requirements -> Design -> Tasks with a review at each step
- CodeLens for Tasks: execute an individual task from `tasks.md` via Codex and auto-check it off

### 🎯 STEERING Management

- Steering Documents: browse and edit global/project-specific guidelines
- Generated Docs: product, tech, and structure steering documents

### 🧩 PROMPTS

- Create Prompts: scaffold `.codex/prompts/<name>.md` from the Prompts view
- Click to Open: clicking a prompt opens the Markdown for review
- Inline Run Button: use the ▶ action on the right to execute with Codex CLI
- Organize & Refresh: manage a workspace prompt library with quick refresh
- Markdown Simplicity: no front-matter required; write plain Markdown instructions

### 💬 CHAT

- Sidebar Chat (webview): start quick conversations with Codex inside VS Code
- Run once or stream: send a one-off message or stream via a dedicated Codex terminal session
- Stop anytime: terminate the active session from the Chat view

### 🚫 Temporarily Disabled Views/Flows

- AGENTS, HOOKS, MCP views: hidden in this build
- "New Spec with Agents" flow: disabled

3. Search for "Kiro for Codex"
4. Click Install

Or via command line:

```bash
code --install-extension atman-33.kiro-for-codex
```

### From VSIX file

Download the latest `.vsix` from GitHub Releases, then:

```bash
# VS Code
code --install-extension kiro-for-codex-{latest-version}.vsix
```

Replace `{latest-version}` with the actual version number, e.g., `0.2.4`.

## Usage

### Creating a Spec

Recommended flow:
1. Click the Kiro for Codex icon in the activity bar
2. In the SPEC view, click `+ Create New Spec`
3. A webview editor opens; describe your feature/request
4. The extension generates the requirements document with Codex CLI
5. Review and approve before proceeding to design
6. Generate tasks after design is complete

Tip: From `tasks.md`, use the inline CodeLens action to execute a single task and auto-check it off.

### Spec Workflow

1. Requirements: define what you want to build
2. Design: create technical design after requirements approval
3. Tasks: generate implementation tasks after design approval
4. Implementation: execute tasks one by one

### Steering Documents

Create project-specific guidance:

- Click the sparkle icon to create custom steering
- Generate initial docs (product, tech, structure)
- Documents are stored under `.codex/steering/`

### Prompts

Create and run project prompts:

1. Open the Prompts view in the activity bar
2. Click `+ Create Prompt` to scaffold `.codex/prompts/<name>.md`
3. Write instructions in Markdown (no front-matter required)
4. Click the prompt item to open the file and review the content
5. Press the inline ▶ Run button to execute the prompt with Codex CLI (split view)

### Chat

Use the Chat view to quickly iterate with Codex:

1. Open the Chat view under the Kiro activity container
2. Type a message and choose run mode (send once or stream)
3. For streaming, the conversation continues in a dedicated Codex terminal session
4. Use Stop to end the active session

### Overview

The Overview view provides quick access to settings, availability checks, and helpful entry points.

- `kiroCodex.checkForUpdates`: Manually trigger the extension update checker

## Configuration

Project-local settings are stored in `.codex/settings/kiroCodex-settings.json` and only contain paths. UI visibility and Codex runtime options live in VS Code settings under the `kiroCodex.*` namespace.

Minimal settings file:

```json
{
  "paths": {
    "specs": ".codex/specs",
    "steering": ".codex/steering"
  }
}
```

Notes:
- Only the `paths.*` values are honored by the extension at runtime.
- These path values are no longer exposed in VS Code's Settings UI; update `.codex/settings/kiroCodex-settings.json` directly if you need to customize them.
- Changing `paths.*` may require a window reload to take effect.
- The settings file itself always lives at `.codex/settings/kiroCodex-settings.json`; the directory cannot be relocated.
- Prompts are always stored under `.codex/prompts`; this location is not configurable.
- On Windows, override the terminal used for Codex runs by setting `kiroCodex.codex.windowsShellPath` in VS Code settings (leave blank to inherit the default).

## Workspace Structure

The extension creates the following structure in your workspace:

```plain

## Inspiration

Kiro for Codex was inspired by the excellent "Kiro for CC" project for Claude Code by @notdp. This extension started as a port/adaptation from Claude Code's Kiro to a Codex CLI–focused workflow, carrying over the spec-driven development experience and UI while integrating tightly with Codex CLI.
